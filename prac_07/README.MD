# Practical Repository 

## Introduction

This repository contains practical exercises and examples for CP1404, designed to reinforce key concepts in Python programming and software development. I'm Samuel Fernandez, IT student, from Colombia. Looking to develop a career related with computers and security systems. I find it interesting.

Clean Code Lessons Learned

- Write descriptive and meaningful variable names to make code more readable.

- Adhere strictly to Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) to improve maintainability and clarity.

- Refactor frequently to avoid duplication (Don't Repeat Yourself - DRY).
